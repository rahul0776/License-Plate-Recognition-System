# License-Plate-Recognition-System
License Plate Recognition Systems use the concept of optical character recognition to read the characters on a vehicle license plate. In other words, LPR takes the image of a vehicle as the input and outputs the characters written on its license plate.<br>
<h2>LPR sometimes called ALPR (Automatic License Plate Recognition) has 3 major stages.</h2>


License Plate Detection: This is the first and probably the most important stage of the system. It is at this stage that the position of the license plate is determined. The input at this stage is an image of the vehicle and the output is the license plate.
Character Segmentation: It’s at this stage the characters on the license plate are mapped out and segmented into individual images.
Character Recognition: This is where we wrap things up. The characters earlier segmented are identified here. We’ll be using machine learning for this.
